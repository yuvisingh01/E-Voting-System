# E-voting-system

This is an E-Voting System which was built focusing convenience in traditional & boring voting procedure. 
This system will be enabling organisations to conduct online elections over the web as per their convenience,
without bothering about the long queues at polling stations. This system has some good UI and is desktop compatible.
It gives us the ability to conduct elections at multiple positions at the same time.
 


#Brief on  Model
- This has an admin panel where admin can control all the actions like registering voters(prevents fake registrations),
   deleting voters, 
   organising an election campaigns,
   adding candidates.
   
-This has a voter applincation page where new voters can apply by contacting the admin
   now admin will verify the user details and register him/her and notify the applicant once done.
   
- once voter gets registered he/she now can vote in the ongoing campaign, one voter can give vote only once in a particular position.


- All vote counts are live for the voters with candidate names and their figures.




#Future Plans 
- I've planned to enable biometric authentication for the login process, so that no one can compromise with other voter's credentials
  and couldn't  barge into the process without voters authority.
  
-I can make it mobile compatible to make it usable over different devices.
-UI will be improved.





***Till the stay tuned!***
